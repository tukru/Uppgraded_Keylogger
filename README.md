Upgraded Keylogger

This is an upgraded version of a basic keylogger program written in C++. The upgraded keylogger captures all keystrokes made on the target computer and encrypts them using a simple XOR cipher. The encrypted data is then stored in a harmless-looking file in a hidden location.
Requirements

To run the upgraded keylogger on Windows, you need the following:

    A Windows computer (Windows 7 or later)
    A C++ compiler (such as Visual Studio or MinGW)
    The windows.h header file

Usage

To use the upgraded keylogger, follow these steps:

    Compile the upgraded_keylogger.c file using your preferred C++ compiler. For example, if you're using MinGW, you can run the following command in the terminal:

    bash

    i686-w64-mingw32-g++ upgraded_keylogger.c -o keylogger-upgraded.exe

    Once the program is compiled, run the keylogger-upgraded.exe file on the target computer.

    The keylogger will start capturing all keystrokes made on the computer, including passwords and other sensitive information. The captured data will be encrypted and stored in a harmless-looking file in a hidden location.

    To stop the keylogger, press Ctrl + C in the terminal where the program is running.
